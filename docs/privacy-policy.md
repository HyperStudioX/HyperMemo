# Privacy Policy for HyperMemo

**Effective Date:** January 8, 2026

HyperMemo ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Chrome Extension and associated services.

## 1. Information We Collect
To provide our AI-powered knowledge management features, we collect the following types of information:

*   **Account Data**: When you sign in via Google OAuth, we receive your email address and name. This is used to create your account, sync your data across devices, and manage your subscription.
*   **Bookmarked Content**: When you explicitly save a page using HyperMemo, we collect the page URL, title, and the primary text of the page. This content is used to generate AI summaries and enable our "Chat with your knowledge" (RAG) feature.
*   **User-Generated Content**: We store the notes you write, tags you assign, and your conversation history with the AI assistant.
*   **Technical Data**: We store local preferences (such as theme and language settings) in your browser’s local storage to provide a consistent user experience.

## 2. How We Use Your Information
We use the collected data strictly to:
*   Provide, maintain, and improve the HyperMemo experience.
*   Generate AI-powered summaries and smart tags for your saved content.
*   Allow you to query and chat with your saved knowledge base.
*   Manage your Pro subscription and billing status.
*   Synchronize your saved intellectual property across your browsers.

## 3. Data Storage and Security
*   **Local Storage**: Some data is stored locally in your browser to ensure speed and offline access to preferences.
*   **Cloud Infrastructure**: Your bookmarks, notes, and chat history are stored securely using Supabase (a backend-as-a-service provider). We utilize Row Level Security (RLS) to ensure that only you can access your own data.
*   **Data Minimization**: We do not track your general browsing history. Data is only collected from pages where you actively click "Save" or "Capture."

## 4. Third-Party Service Providers
We share relevant data with a limited number of sub-processors required to provide our service:
*   **Supabase**: For database storage and authentication.
*   **Stripe**: For secure payment processing (we never see or store your credit card information).
*   **AI Providers**: To generate summaries and chat responses, sanitized text content is processed by Large Language Model providers (via our secure backend). We do not permit these providers to use your data to train their models.

## 5. Your Rights and Data Deletion
You have full control over your data:
*   **Deletion**: You can delete any bookmark, note, or chat session at any time through the dashboard. This removes the data from our active databases.
*   **Account Closure**: You may request full account deletion by contacting us, which will remove all associated user data.

## 6. Transparency & Compliance
HyperMemo adheres to the Chrome Web Store User Data Policy, including the requirements for "Least Privilege" and "Single Purpose." We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties for advertising or marketing purposes.
